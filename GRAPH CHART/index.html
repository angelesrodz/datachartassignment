 <p id="paragraph"> Runners in the New York City Marathon experienced heat illness on the warmest day in the history of the annual athletic event. This November 6th recorded a maximum temperature of 75° degrees Fahrenheit in Central Park, according to the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=okx">National Weather Service.</a>
</p>
  
<br>

<p id="paragraph">Data from the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/past-weather/new%20york%20city">National Centers for Environmental Information</a> shows other years where the weather averages that were unseasonably warm are 1994 with 66° ; 2003 with 63° ; and 2005 with 61°. The ideal temperature for marathoners would be between 50 and 62 degrees, stated a <a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2022/01000/Effects_of_Weather_Parameters_on_Endurance_Running.19.aspx">recent article from the American College of Sports Medicine.</a>

<p id="paragraph">New York Road Runners, the organization in charge of the city’s marathon, mentioned in it’s website that <a href="https://results.nyrr.org/event/M2022/overview">47,839 finished the race</a> from more than 50,000 registered participants. Nonetheless, many reported experiencing heat-related injuries such as dehydration and hyperthermia. Lili Roy, a physician and professor at NYU Langone who volunteered in a medical tent near the finish line, attested to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-11-08/heat-injuries-abound-at-unseasonably-warm-new-york-city-marathon">Bloomberg</a>  that the most common symptom was nausea.

<p id="paragraph">“Runners at this year[’s marathon] might not have been prepared for those kind of temperatures and that level of humidity that was experienced on the day of the marathon and their training might not have set them up to be ready for running such a long distance in that kind of weather,” commented Casey Ivanovich, a PhD candidate at Columbia University who studies the effects of extreme heat and humidity.
</p>

<br>

<p id="paragraph">NYRR created a <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/race-day/2022-warm-weather-updates">Warm Weather Updates guide</a> to help runners prepare ahead of time for the unseasonably warm weather. 
</p>

<br>

<p id="paragraph">To Ivanovich, the extreme weather experienced during the marathon is a clear indication that climate change is already taking its toll. “We're already seeing that these impacts are here. And so, we really need to increase any kind of adaptation measures we can in order to make people safer,” she said. 
</p>

<br>

<p id="paragraph">As for possible solutions to combat heat illnesses, Ivanovich mentioned increasing the amount of green spaces and tree cover, and to make sure people have access to cooling centers. “We need to make sure the electric grid can also support increasing energy demand as more and more people need that sort of artificial cooling.”
